                        <li>5 tablespoons cornstarch</li>

                </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place tofu onto a plate lined with several paper towels. Cover 
                        with more paper towels and another plate. Set a 3- to 5-pound 
                        weight on top and press tofu for 30 minutes. Drain and discard 
                        any accumulated liquid.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place tofu cubes in a shallow bowl. Add 2 tablespoons soy 
                        sauce and sesame oil. Gently stir to coat. Let sit for 10 
                        minutes or until tofu has absorbed most of the liquid.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce by whisking soy sauce, maple 
                        syrup, sambal oelek, rice vinegar, garlic, sesame oil, 
                        cornstarch, and green onions together in a bowl. Set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>Drain any remaining liquid from the tofu. Place cornstarch 
                        in a gallon-sized plastic resealable bag. Drop tofu cubes 
                        in the bag, seal, and gently shake until coated with cornstarch.
                    </li>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook 
                        tofu for 4 minutes. Flip with tongs and cook until browned on 
                        all sides, about 4 minutes more. Transfer tofu to a plate and 
                        wipe the skillet clean.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour sauce into the skillet and cook until slightly thickened, 
                        about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Return tofu to the skillet 
                        and toss to combine.
                    </li>
                </ol>
